                    Hi! My name is Iurii. I love to work on projects, always thinking about how to improve things, make them better. In early days I was dreaming to work in web development, but didn't have that chance or didn't want to make enough
                    effort to go there. After many years spent working in manufacturing environment, the time came by and I am learning for the switch!

                            Finally I found what I have been looking for. I had to quit my Schaeffler career and dive into learning for my new career. LaunchCode in a non-profit organization, which is teaching the students what really needs for the
                            employers on demand. Then appreticeship program is going to give a work experience. I understand about the career switching and the pay will have a cut, but I do this for the future career opportunities, which in the few
                            years will be appreciated.
                        </p>
                        <p>During my days of education and updating my skills. I love what I am doing, no stress at all. I was always thinking about this switch, and I am coming for that!</p>

                        <p>
                            This was an amazing experience working there, in the automotive business with a fast pace environment. I think this is the longest time I had with the same employer. When I lost my job at Doyle Dickerson Terrazzo, I was
                            looking for a present to my son, and found a used xbox on craigslist. When we get to the place to pick up his present, we met the guy who work in Schaeffler, his name is Daniel. We talked little bit about xbox games and
                            soccer (he is German). So when I told him that I am in active job search, he helped me to get into the company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My journey in the company started as a material handler/forklift operator. After about 8 months I was promoted to a machine operator and be able to understand machinery, with my computer science and problem-solving skills
                            I was doing great. After a year and a half I got another promotion to be a floater, which is one of the employees who knows most of the machines in the department. At that time I was thinking about switching the career
                            back to software development, but the pay was good at the current job and then I received another promotion after another year. I became an assembly specialist, which is basically a technician in machinery, pay was raised
                            higher than the floter. In another six months I got another promotion to become a production supervisor to manage a department.

                        <p>
                            I was working there from 2014 and from the end of 2016 had a manager position, that holded me there, because of pay, but I didn't like that career in manufacturing, also I felt like I stuck there with no promotions within
                            last 5 years. I started looking for switching the career back into software development in the fall of 2021, but couldn't get any offers, since my skills had to be updated. November 2021 I found LaunchCode!

                            After I moved to the US, this was my first company I worked full-time. Basically it is a construction flooring company based in Charlotte, but we were doing site jobs in south east region including South Carolina, Georgia,
                            Florida, Virginia, Maryland, Alabama. This was a good experience to work on american company, even most of the languages used in the team are spanish or russian. I worked there as a helper on job sites for about 4-5
                            months, and then transitioned in their warehouse at Charlotte NC as a forklift operator. It was hard to work there, but we do what we have to do.

                            After a little while I had to move on and find something with more pay to live on that. My mom was working in Perm GRES power station in our little town. It was a good experience to try another job in a completely
                            different sector. I was hired there as an operator of a steam turbine, it was an easy job, most of the days and nights I was responsible to make sure everything is working and running at rate. No computer experience there.
                            I enjoyed work there for five years, there was a great team to work with.

                            I would call this place as a start of my full time career back in the mid of 2000s. It was a wonderful place to work. There were a bunch of computers connected to a local network with all of the popular games for kids to
                            play on, and I was working there as a system administrator. I loved to work there even with that minimal wage, but I was around 18 and could play games all shift long unless, there is a problem in the network or computers.
